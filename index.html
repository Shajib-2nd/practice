        <p>Bangladesh, located in South Asia, is a vibrant and densely populated country known for its rich culture,
            natural
            beauty, and resilience. Bordered by India, Myanmar, and the Bay of Bengal, it boasts lush green landscapes,
            the world’s
            largest mangrove forest—the Sundarbans—and the mighty rivers Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna. Bangladesh
            gained
            independence in 1971 and has since made remarkable strides in economic growth, education, and technology.
            Its thriving
            textile industry significantly contributes to global fashion. Celebrated for its hospitality, diverse
            cuisine, and
            festivals like Pohela Boishakh, Bangladesh continues to inspire with its rich heritage and determination to
            overcome
            challenges.</p>
